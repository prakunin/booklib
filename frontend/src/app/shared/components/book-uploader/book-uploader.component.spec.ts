// NOTE(frontend-seam): Honest coverage for this component needs an Optimus UI FileUpload host seam,
// controllable library/settings signals, and a stable upload-progress harness for `HttpRequest`
// event streams and dialog close behavior. The current surface mixes view-child state, effects,
// progress events, and UI messaging too tightly for a reliable low-noise unit spec tonight.
